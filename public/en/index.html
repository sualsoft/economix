                <p>The IAB Job Survey has been carried out annually since 1989. It is aimed at a representative selection of companies and administrative offices in West and East Germany. The farms are selected at random every year in order to keep the burden on the individual farms low.</p>

                <p>Participation is voluntary, but we hope for your support! Your answers are very important to us, because only if we receive enough information from companies on personnel policy and staffing can we draw well-founded scientific conclusions about the current and future dynamics on the labour market. Please support us in this.</p>

                <h3>Results</h3>
                <p>The survey results are highly relevant both for practice-oriented policy advice and for scientific research, because the IAB job survey is unique in Germany. The resulting studies have a major influence on the decisions in the labour market policy of the federal government, the federal states and in Europe. At regular intervals, the IAB publishes press releases, short reports and articles in order to make the results available to a broad public.

        <h3>Level of requirements of the occupations</h3>
        <p>
          The occupation information is recorded according to the Classification
          of Occupations 2010. In addition to the exact job title, this also
          requires information on the level of requirements:
        </p>

        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>
              Positions that usually do not require a formal vocational
              qualification or a maximum of one year of regular vocational
              training correspond to the level of "helper". This also includes
              civil servants in the simple service.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Bodies that have in-depth specialist knowledge, which is usually
              acquired in the context of a 2- to 3-year vocational/technical
              school education, have the level of "specialist". This also
              includes civil servants in the middle service.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Positions requiring complex activities, planning and control
              tasks, specialist knowledge and skills are assigned to the
              "Specialist" level. Usually, activities that require a master
              craftsman/technician training or a bachelor's degree, or civil
              servants in the higher service are included.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Positions for highly specialized activities, e.g. in development,
              research or diagnosis, management and management tasks in large
              companies, which usually require at least 4 years of higher
              education (master's degree, diploma or state examination, etc.) or
              in which civil servants are employed in the higher service,
              correspond to the level "expert".
            </p>
          </li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Employment Agency</h3>
        <p>
          This includes the local agencies of the Federal Employment Agency, the
          working groups between the Federal Agency and the municipalities
          (joint institutions, gE) and the municipal institutions for job
          placement (job center). Private employment agencies, on the other
          hand, are not one of them.
        </p>

        <h3>Employees</h3>
        <p>
          The number of employees includes all those working in your company: in
          addition to the employees and workers, also the owners/
          <br /><br />
          -inside, the family workers, the marginally employed (e.g. mini-jobs)
          and the trainees. In the case of public authorities and state-owned
          enterprises, civil servants and judges must also be counted. There
          must be a direct employment contract with employees. Freelancers,
          employees on loan via temporary work, subsidised employment
          relationships (FAV) and one-euro jobs are not counted.
        </p>

        <h3>Notified body</h3>
        <p>
          A registered position includes unsubsidized employment relationships,
          which are registered by employers to the employment agencies and basic
          security institutions for placement (without seasonal jobs).
        </p>

        <h3>Temporary /temporary work</h3>
        <p>
          Temporary/temporary workers are hired by temporary employment
          companies and loaned to temporary employment companies for a limited
          time. They are therefore not employees or employees subject to social
          security contributions in the company in which they are employed for a
          limited period of time. An employment contract exists between the
          temporary employment agency and the borrowed person.

          The IAB job survey is carried out nationwide by the Economix Research
          & Consulting Institute on behalf of the Institute for Employment
          Research (IAB), the research institution of the Federal Employment
          Agency (BA). The legal basis for this is Â§ 282 Abs. 5 SGB III. It is a
          written main survey and three possible telephone follow-up surveys. TM
          Quadrat GmbH acts as a service provider for the short follow-up
          surveys in the first three quarters of the following year. All
          participating institutes bear the responsibility under data protection
          law and work in accordance with the extensive legal provisions on data
          protection.
        </p>
        <h3>Origin of addresses</h3>
        <p>
          The following information is transmitted to the Economix survey
          institute: name and address of the company, company number, number of
          employees subject to social security contributions as of 31.12. of the
          previous year, industry identifiers and existing contact information
          of a contact person. The legal basis for this is Article 28 GDPR.
        </p>
        <h3>What happens to your data?</h3>
        <p>
          After you have returned the completed questionnaire to us, Economix
          will separate it from your address. This remains with Economix until
          the end of the investigation and is then deleted. Of course, this also
          applies if you answer the questionnaire online. The information
          provided by all companies is processed anonymously in a large data set
          in which it is combined with information that is already available at
          the Federal Employment Agency about the company. The merging takes
          place exclusively via an anonymous code number, i.e. without name and
          address.
        </p>
        <p>
          This data set is then evaluated at the IAB for scientific purposes. In
          principle, the following applies: None of the scientists is able to
          recognize from which company which information originates, address
          information is not accessible to them. The presentation of all results
          is completely anonymous. This means that no one can see from the
          results what answers individual companies or administrations have
          given. This also applies to the short telephone repeat surveys in the
          first three quarters of the following year. The identification of
          individual companies or administrations is also not possible here.
        </p>
        <h3>Voluntary participation</h3>
        <p>
          Your participation is of course voluntary, and you have the right to
          withdraw your participation at any time. In the event of
          non-participation or revocation, you will not incur any disadvantages.
          The revocation does not affect the previous processing.
        </p>
        <h3>Your rights and our guarantees</h3>
        <p>
          You can assert the following rights with regard to your survey data at
          any time:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><p>Right</p></li>
          <li><p>Right to rectification</p></li>
          <li><p>Right to restriction of processing</p></li>
          <li><p>Right to erasure</p></li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          In case of complaints, you can also contact the responsible data
          protection supervisory authority. The research institutes involved in
          this project guarantee you:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>Your information will only be evaluated in anonymous form;</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              the address of your company will in no case be passed on to third
              parties;
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              the scientists involved in the collection and evaluation are bound
